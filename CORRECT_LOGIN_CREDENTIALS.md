# ✅ **Correct Login Credentials - WORKING**

## 🔧 **Fixed Authentication Issues**

The authentication system now supports **both username and email** login. The backend has been updated to handle the flexible login format from the frontend.

## 🔑 **Working Test Credentials**

Use these credentials for both **local testing** and **Render deployment**:

### **👑 Admin Access**
```
Username: demo_admin
Password: admin123
```
**Or using email:**
```
Email: admin@iimtrichy.ac.in  
Password: admin123
```

### **🎓 Student Access**
```
Username: demo_student
Password: student123
```
**Or using email:**
```
Email: student001@iimtrichy.ac.in
Password: student123
```

### **🔧 Staff Access**
```
Username: demo_electrical
Password: staff123
```
**Or using email:**
```
Email: electrical@iimtrichy.ac.in
Password: staff123
```

## 🚀 **Testing Instructions**

### **Local Testing (http://localhost:3000)**
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Use any of the credentials above
3. Should login successfully with debug info in browser console

### **Render Testing (https://hostel-ticketing-frontend.onrender.com)**
1. Make sure `REACT_APP_API_URL` environment variable is set:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL = https://hostel-ticketing-portal.onrender.com/api
   ```
2. Redeploy frontend service if needed
3. Use same credentials as local testing

## 🔍 **Backend Authentication Fixes Applied**

1. **✅ Updated UserController** to accept both `email` and `usernameOrEmail` fields
2. **✅ Added UserService methods** for username/email authentication
3. **✅ Added UserRepository methods** for flexible user lookup
4. **✅ Enhanced error responses** with proper HTTP status codes
5. **✅ Maintained backward compatibility** with existing frontend

## 🐛 **Debug Information**

The frontend now logs authentication details in browser console:
- NODE_ENV
- REACT_APP_API_URL value
- Computed API_BASE_URL
- Actual login URL being called

## 📋 **What Was Fixed**

### **Root Cause:** 
Frontend was sending `email` field but backend wasn't flexible enough to handle both username and email login as expected by users.

### **Solution:**
- Backend now accepts both username and email in the `email` field
- Added fallback to `usernameOrEmail` field for maximum compatibility
- Authentication works with either username or email address
- Proper error handling with structured responses

## ✅ **Verification**

Backend authentication endpoints tested and verified:
- ✅ `demo_admin` / `admin123` → SUCCESS
- ✅ `demo_student` / `student123` → SUCCESS  
- ✅ `demo_electrical` / `staff123` → SUCCESS
- ✅ Email login also works for all users
- ✅ Proper JSON responses with user data
- ✅ Error handling for invalid credentials

**All login issues are now resolved for both local and Render deployment!** 🎉
